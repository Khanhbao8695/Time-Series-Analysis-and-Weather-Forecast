# Time Series Analysis and Weather Forecast Project

## Project Description
This project is an experimental Data Science side project using Python to conduct Time Series Analysis and Weather Forecasts.

## Data Source
The data have been downloaded from the website https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services. he data are average daily temperatures collected in Tampa, Florida, USA from December 9th,2016 to December 9th, 2021 (5 years period).

## Tasks

This project sets and addresses the following questions: 
* How to conduct a Time-Series Analysis project from raw data?
* How to deal with a Time-Series data that has seasonality?
* Implementing the Moving Average to capture long-term fluctuations
* Parameter Selection for the model using GRID Search
* Make Weather Forecasts using the SARIMAX model
* How to diagnose the model performance using charts and other metrics (AIC score, RMSE value)?
